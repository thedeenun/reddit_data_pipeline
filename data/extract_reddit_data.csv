I just want to track my heart rate and heart rate zones which I suspect will give me a better idea of how long I'll need to recover after.

1hdfrz7,"Fenix 8 Solar 51mm Review: A fantastic, end-game quality watch…if it weren’t for confounding, unforced problems",125,65,alycks,"There have been a few threads in the past few days asking about the Fenix 8 and whether we F8 owners are satisfied with our purchases. I thought I'd write up my quick impressions based on my very heavy usage as an ultrarunner and triathlete.

I've owned the following Garmin watches:

* Forerunner 645 Music
* Forerunner 945 LTE
* Epix 2
* Enduro 2
* Epix Pro
* Fenix 8 Solar

I'm also a borderline Garmin obsessive: I also own:

* Edge 1050
* HRM-Pro Plus
* Index S2 Scale
* Index S2 BPM (in the mail)

I've always been a very happy Garmin customer. I convinced my wife to upgrade from an Apple Watch to a Forerunner 265S, and a friend from his Galaxy watch to a Forerunner 965. This Fenix 8, however, is really testing the bounds of my loyalty. I went through three units until landing on one that was satisfactory:

1. Fenix 8 Solar - took absolutely forever to acquire a GPS signal. I wrote that up extensively [here](https://forums.garmin.com/outdoor-recreation/outdoor-recreation/f/fenix-8-series/387848/fenix-8-solar-47mm-takes-too-long-to-acquire-gps-signal---a-study).
2. Fenix 8 Solar - purchased to verify whether it was a hardware issue. This watch functioned normally, so I returned both of them.
3. Fenix 8 Solar - I wanted the larger case, so I bought this one and crossed my fingers that it would acquire GPS signal as quickly as every other Garmin watch I've ever owned.

This was made worse by the customer support at Garmin. One representative had the gall to tell me that ""3-5 minutes to acquire a GPS signal"" was perfectly within spec and that it wasn't eligible for a warranty exchange. Another rep told me I had to work through the retailer, a small business, for a refund. I had to pay return shipping.

That said, I love this watch. For my use case, the Fenix 8 Solar 51mm is an end-game kind of device. It's good enough to replace my Epix Pro and my Apple Watch Ultra. Or, at least, it would be. If it worked properly.

# Design: 10/10

I have owned lots of premium Garmin watches, including a MARQ Adventurer and Athlete for very brief periods of time. The Fenix 8 Solar looks better than all of them, including the MARQs. It looks muscular and refined. The 51mm Enduro 2 wore much larger on the wrist for some reason. The 51mm sits lower and more flush and has a smaller visual footprint. I love everything about this watch's design. The MARQ does look more refined, but it doesn't go with my ""athlesiure,"" GORP-core aesthetic as well. 

I prefer MIP to AMOLED from an aesthetic standpoint, at least on Garmin watches. Garmin's AMOLED standby, even on the Epix Pro, is too dim and in bright environments just looks like a black circle when the wrist is down. Funnily enough, Apple absolutely nails this. The AWU2 display looks wonderful indoors and outdoors. They do a much better job of adjusting the ambient brightness.

The MIP display looks like an actual watch, and is both easier to see in the sunlight and more subtle indoors. The Fenix 8 MIP screen is the best I've used on any watch.

I absolutely love the leak-proof dive buttons. I hope to own this watch for 8-10 years and the extra waterproof-edness gives me peace of mind.

# Sports and Health Performance: 9/10

Not much to say here, other than I actually do prefer the new UI to the old one. I find it more intuitive to use both during activities and general use. I also feel like the Fenix 8 is more accurate for lap swimming than the Epix Pro was, though it's possible I'm just better at swimming with it now.

I took off one point for poor heart rate accuracy during fast, short interval runs and strength training. I always wear a heart rate monitor so this absolutely never impacts me, but the AWU2 is noticeably better (though still not perfect) at this.

# Smartwatch/Lifestyle Features: 9/10

This is graded somewhat on a curve. I can't truly measure it against the AWU2 because such a comparison would not be on a level playing field. I have to measure it against the best possible smartwatch Garmin *could* make given the iOS context.

I upgraded, in part, due to the mic and speaker. Roughly 90% of my mic/speaker use on the AWU2 is setting timers and alarms and the Fenix 8 handles that very, very well with the Voice Commands (i.e., on-watch) feature.

The Phone Assistant feature is not very good, but I think that's mostly Apple's fault. It works for the rare occasions when my iPhone is in my backpack and I can't or don't want to pull it out to send a quick message. It's a far cry from the AWU2, but I don't hold that against Garmin. They had more control over the Voice Commands feature, and that was executed very well, I feel.

The LED flashlight is just about a must-have for me these days. Huge feature. Other than that, I use the Fenix 8 to look at my calendars, check the weather and tides, pay with Garmin Pay, and, y'know, check the time. I took one point off because the Phone Assistant UI is really slow and the watch doesn't always buzz when dictation is available.

Unlike many others, I actually find the health and slumber* tracking very accurate and useful. It tracks very closely with both my Apple Watch and my subjective slumber ratings. 

# Reliability: 4/10

This is the first Garmin I've ever owned that wasn't 99-100% reliable for its core feature: accurately tracking sports activities. For a while, the watch would reboot when saving an activity. This has been resolved, but I lost several runs this way.

Lately, the watch has been rebooting in weird moments during totally regular usage. I'm not running beta software or doing anything terribly niche: just changing sports and editing data screens.

If Garmin is going to charge $400 more than the AWU2, it needs to be more reliable. I'm still so unsure of this device that I'm always wearing my AWU2 on the other wrist now as a backup in case the Garmin fails to save an important event.

# Battery Life: 2/10

This is also graded on a curve, but the battery life is one of the three reasons I own a Garmin at all. Last Thursday night, before my Saturday marathon, I charged the watch to 100%. In the past week I have averaged 44m of GPS activities plus a few swims and indoor trainer rides. Battery life today is 14%. That's 86% drain in 8 days for a total expected battery life of 9.3 days.

I'm not exactly sure how Garmin expects us to swallow that kind of performance. My Enduro 2, under arguably heavier use, would last 3 weeks, minimum. In the summertime, with open water swimming and outdoor running, and thus plenty of solar charging, I once went 28 days on the Enduro 2. Nine days is embarrassing and unacceptable.

# Overall: 6/10 (as-is), 9/10 (hopeful), so 8/10 for now

I'm giving the watch an ""aspirational"" grade, which you might disagree with. It seems to me that the two main issues I'm suffering from are fixable through software updates and optimizations. When I think about the watch as a whole, the following things stick out to me:

* The launch and purchasing process of this watch was frustrating, time-consuming, and will always be a stain on Garmin in my mind. Garmin has always been a fantastic company to work with. There were so many unforced errors in the launch of this watch and I spent so much time troubleshooting a defective unit and dealing with shipping back replacement devices.
* I've never before questioned whether my watch would successfully save an activity. I didn't dare run my marathon this past weekend, my first ever road marathon, without a backup watch, because I don't fully trust the Fenix 8 yet. Garmin should be fairly ashamed of this fact when every other Garmin I've ever used has been rock-solid.
* I've never been happier with the look and feel of a Garmin watch. It looks and feels premium and badass.
* It's still clear how dedicated Garmin is to endurance athletes. I love all the features of the watch, even the ""gee, whiz"" ones like Endurance Score.
* The LED flashlight. Not only do I use it almost every day, it saved my ass on one occasion on a sub-freezing, pre-dawn trail run when my headlamp conked out.
* Garmin charges $1,200 for this watch and advertises 30 days of smartwatch usage, or 48 days with solar charging. I used to own an $1,100 Enduro 2 which nailed those benchmarks easily. A paltry 9-12 days is downright embarrassing.

I'm rooting for this watch to get better over time. Hopefully Garmin manages to improve the battery life and reliability issues. Until then, I'm not sure I'd recommend it to anyone over the Fenix 7 Pro. The potential Fenix 8 buyer would run the risk of ending up with an unreliable, battery-poor device that might take a long time to acquire a GPS signal and not always save activities. 

The Fenix 7 Pro is a slam dunk. The Fenix 8 Solar, while in all other regards a superior device, cannot satisfactorily perform its core features of (i) activity tracking and (ii) battery life.
